PyViz Assignment - Building a prototype dashboard for Toronto Real Estate Investment.

## Background
The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

The data provided for this assignment was retrieved from the following websites:

* [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/)
* [Census Profile, 2016 Census - Toronto Metropolitan Area, Ontario and Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=535&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=toronto&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=0)

## Resources

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Mapbox API

## Instructions
The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an [analysis notebook](). Once the code is running properly, it can be copied over to a dashboard code and used with Panel to create the final layout.
